\title{Compare two answers of the pk values.}
\usage{
compare_pks(pk1, pk2)
}
\arguments{
\item{pk1}{a list, the output of the function calculate_pk().}

\item{pk2}{a list, the output of the function calculate_pk().}
}
\value{
a list containing all the variables during the calculation.
    The value list$type is "PKC", which indicated the list is return-value of the function compare_pk().
    The type of list$group is also a list, which contains the normal distribution test results for the group variables.
    The type of list$pair is also a list, which contains the t distribution test results for the pair variables.
    The type of list$details is also a list, which contains all the intermediate variables during the calculation.
}
\description{
Both of the two input have to be the output of the function calculate_pk().
