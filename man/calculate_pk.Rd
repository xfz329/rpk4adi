\title{Compute the PK value to Measure the Performance of Anesthetic Depth Indicators.}
\usage{
calculate_pk(x_in, y_in)
}
\arguments{
\item{x_in}{a vector, the indicator.}

\item{y_in}{a vector, the state.}
}
\value{
a list containing all the matrices and variables during the calculation.
    The value list$type is "PK", which indicated the list is the return-value of the function calculate_pk().
    The type of list$basic is also a list, which contains the most important results of the function.
    The type of list$matrices is also a list, which contains all the matrices during the calculation.
    The type of list$details is also a list, which contains all the intermediate variables during the calculation.
